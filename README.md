# Weather app
The [**weather app**](https://github.com/eliona-smart-building-assistant/weather-app) is an exemplary app build for running within an [eliona](https://www.eliona.io/) environment. Apps like this add new features to eliona like supporting additional sensors or open new communication channels.

This app grabs weather data from [WeatherDB](https://weatherdbi.herokuapp.com/) web service and writes temperature, humidity, wind and precipitation to eliona. To do this, you can configure locations for which the weather data is to be read. Within eliona these locations are handled as assets and can be used to show on dashboards, trigger alarms and so on.
